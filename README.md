# ALPINE — Authenticated Lighting Protocol (v1.0)

ALPINE is a **modern, secure, vendor-agnostic lighting control protocol** designed to replace legacy systems such as sACN/E1.31, RDMnet, and proprietary device APIs.

ALPINE provides:

- **Discovery** — secure device identification without knowing IP
- **Handshake** — mutual authentication & key agreement
- **Control Plane** — reliable, signed envelopes
- **Streaming Layer** — low-latency, real-time lighting frames
- **Capability System** — device declares its features
- **Extensibility** — vendor namespaces, structured envelopes
- **No universes, no DMX limits** — modern frame model

ALPINE is built around:
- **CBOR** for compact structured messages
- **Ed25519** signatures
- **X25519** key exchange
- **UDP broadcast** discovery
- **UDP or QUIC streaming**
- **Deterministic session state machine**

## Continuous Integration

- `UDP E2E Tests` workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`) runs `cargo test --tests -- --ignored` from `src/alnp`, exercising the real UDP handshake/control/streaming paths on Linux.

## Publishing & package registries

This project publishes artifacts for Rust, C, TypeScript, and Python. Before running the release scripts or invoking `cargo publish`, set the following credentials in your environment or GitHub secrets:

| Registry | Environment variable | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Packages (Rust) | `CARGO_REGISTRIES_GITHUB_TOKEN` | Used by `cargo publish --registry github`. The GitHub registry index is configured in `src/alnp/Cargo.toml`; also point `CARGO_HOME` at `<repo>/.cargo` (or add the same `[registries.github]` entry inside your global Cargo config) so that the registry is loaded before publishing—otherwise `cargo publish --registry github` will panic with “remote registries must have config”. |
| TypeScript (npm/PNPM) | `NPM_TOKEN` or `PNPM_TOKEN` | Required for publishing `dist/ts` via `npm publish` / `pnpm publish`. |
| Python (PyPI or GitHub) | `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (or `TWINE_USERNAME`/`TWINE_PASSWORD`) | `scripts/build_python.sh` generates wheel/sdist artifcats; upload them with `twine upload`. |
| C artifacts | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Use this token to push `dist/c` (static library + header) to GitHub Packages or release assets. |

## Language Bindings

The reference implementation ships with:

- Rust crate (`alpine-protocol-rs`)
- TypeScript client (`@alpine-core/protocol`)
- C static library + headers
- C++ helper header (`bindings/cpp/alnp.hpp`)
- Python package (`alpine-protocol`)

Each binding provides:

- Discovery
- Handshake
- Session manager
- Control envelope API
- Streaming client/server

## SDK layers

- **Rust**: `src/alnp/src/sdk` exposes `AlpineClient`, which orchestrates discovery, handshake, streaming frames, and keepalive over UDP while reusing the control/crypto helpers.
- **TypeScript**: `bindings/ts/src/sdk/client.ts` wraps the binding helpers with a Node UDP client that exposes `discover()`, `handshake()`, and `sendFrame()` convenience methods.
- **Python**: `bindings/python/src/alnp/sdk` provides a socket-driven class that builds CBOR discovery/control/frame payloads and leaves network I/O to the consumer.
- **C++**: `bindings/cpp/sdk/alpine_sdk.hpp` defines `AlpineTransport` and `AlpineClient` so you can feed encoded discovery/control/frame bytes into your own transport implementation.

Use these SDKs as the primary application entry points, and reserve the auto-generated low-level bindings for embedded or constrained contexts.

## Stream Profiles

Stream behavior is selected via the `StreamProfile` abstraction exported by the Rust SDK (`StreamProfile::Auto`, `StreamProfile::Realtime`, `StreamProfile::Install`).
Each profile represents a declarative intent (safe default, low latency, or install resilience) and compiles into a stable `config_id`.
Calling `client.start_stream(StreamProfile::Auto)` binds the profile to the session once and never lets the runtime swap it silently; every streaming call thereafter respects the profile weights for latency, resilience, and jitter.
Expect the SDK to reject invalid combinations and to document the behavioral guarantees for every exposed profile so consumers understand what changes under packet loss, jitter, or timing pressure.

## Documentation as API contract

ALPINE treats documentation as part of the API contract. Every public surface across Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, C, C++, and Python must explain not only "how" but "what the system guarantees" under latency, packet loss, and load. See `docs/documentation_policy.md` for the language-by-language requirements (doc comments, JSDoc, Doxygen, docstrings, deprecation paths, behavioral guarantees, etc.).

## Embedded mode

The C++ helper exposes an `ALPINE_EMBEDDED` configuration that keeps the API
identical while disabling hidden heap allocations, RTTI, and exception support.
Use `scripts/build_embedded_cpp.sh` or `bindings/cpp/embedded_test.cpp` to verify
the restricted flags (`-fno-exceptions`, `-fno-rtti`, `-fno-threadsafe-statics`,
`-fno-use-cxa-atexit`, `-Os`). The CI job `.github/workflows/embedded.yml` runs
that script for every change to `main`, so ESP32-style builds are validated
alongside the desktop releases.
